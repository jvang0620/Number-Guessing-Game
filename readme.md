#### Overview

This C# console application is a simple Number Guessing Game. The player is prompted to set a range (minimum and maximum values) for the randomly generated number.

After each round, the player has the option to play again. The game continues until the player decides to exit.

#### How .NET is Used in Application

- Developed using `C#`, a primary language supported by the .NET framework.
- Employing .NET Core's `dotnet` commands for building and running the application.
- Leveraging the `Visual Studio Community IDE`, providing the potential for future expansion into a web application.
- Making use of `standard .NET libraries`, including `System` namespaces. For instance:

  ###### User Input and Output (Console):

  - The application interacts with the user through the console. The usage of `Console.WriteLine` to display messages and `Console.ReadLine` to read user input are part of the System namespace in the .NET Framework.
    <br>
    > Console.WriteLine("What would you like your minimal value to be? ");
    > MinValue = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

  ###### Random Number Generation (System.Random):

  - The `Random` class from the System namespace to generate random numbers. This class is part of the .NET Framework and provides methods for generating random integers.
    <br>
    > Random random = new Random();
    > int NumberGenerated = random.Next(MinValue, MaxValue + 1);

  ###### Data Type Conversion:

  - The application uses `Convert.ToInt32` to convert user input (read as strings) into integer values. This conversion functionality is part of the .NET Framework.
    <br>

    > MinValue = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

  ###### String Manipulation:

  - The application uses string manipulation methods, such as `ToUpper`, to process user responses. These string operations are part of the .NET Framework
    <br>

    > Response = Console.ReadLine();
    > Response = Response.ToUpper();

#### Usage

- Enter the minimal and maximal values when prompted.
- Start guessing the number within that range. Enter your guess when prompted.
- After each guess, you'll receive feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
- Keep guessing until you correctly identify the randomly generated number. The game will provide the total number of guesses you made.
- After each round, you have the option to play again. Enter "Y" to start a new game or "N" to exit.
